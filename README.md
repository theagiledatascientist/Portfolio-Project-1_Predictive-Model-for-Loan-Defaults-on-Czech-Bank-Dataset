# Predictive-Model-for-Loan-Defaults-on-Czech-Bank-Dataset
Loans are usually one of the most important products of a bank. Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks. Therefore, banks always pay much attention to detect and predict the default behaviors of their customers. The objective of this project is to build supervised models for loans default predictions and to explore the impact of customer behavioral factors on making predictions further.
